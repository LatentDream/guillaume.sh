            Hi! I'm Guillaume :) Passionate about problem-solving, system building, and art. My journey began with a bachelor's degree in software engineering, where I explored the world of applied mathematics and learned the intricacies of computer systems. Fascinated by their complexity, I completed a professional master's degree in artificial intelligence and data science. I'm interested in the entire software stack, from crafting intuitive user experiences to optimizing backend systems for performance and scalability.
